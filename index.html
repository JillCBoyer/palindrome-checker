      <p>
        A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters
        that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation,
        and capitalization. Examples include "racecar," "madam," "level," and
        "12321." Palindromes can occur in many languages and are often used for
        wordplay or as puzzles. They're pretty neat, aren't they?
